# Bird Guess

Can you match birds to their sound? Have fun while learning to recognize birds.

* You will be shown two bird images and listen to some beautiful singing, chirping or quacking.
* Tap on the bird image that you think matches the sound you hear.
* In the course of 10 round you will collect points for correct guesses and train your knowledge.
* Enjoy discovering nearly 200 birds by their call in this completely free and Open Source game.

## How to run

### Android (Recommended)

* Download the latest APK from [the release page](https://github.com/isensee-bastian/bird-guess/releases) to your Android phone.
* Go to the download location and install the APK from there.
* Afterwards, you should be able to run the game on your phone.

### Local computer (Development mode)

* Clone this repository with `git`.
* Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm`, `TypeScript`, `Ionic Framework`.
* Run the local development server from the cloned repository: `ionic serve`.
* Afterwards you should be able to navigate to the game in your web browser at `http://localhost:8100` (change the configured port if it is already used on your machine).

### Other platforms (Do it yourself)

In theory, this Ionic App should run on other platforms as well, like iOS. However, due to limited resources, I have not built and tested it on other platforms. Feel free to do your own testing and open a PR if you want to suggest changes or improvements.
